    "1. Definition:A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently or scheduled by the Operating System. In the computer system, an Operating System achieves multitasking by dividing the process into threads. A thread is a lightweight process that ensures the execution of the process separately on the system. In Python 3, when multiple processors are running on a program, each processor runs simultaneously to execute its tasks separately. Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes.\n",

    "*CPython implementation detail*: In CPython, due to the **Global Interpreter Lock**, only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries might overcome this limitation). If we want our application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, then we are advised to use *multiprocessing* or *concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor*. However, threading is still an appropriate model if we want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.\n",
